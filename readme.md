# Hangman Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Hangman game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Game Rules

Hangman is a guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, and the others try to guess it by suggesting letters. 

In this digital version, the computer selects a random word from a list, and the player tries to guess it by choosing letters. The game continues until the player has guessed the word or the hangman drawing is complete.

## How to Play

1. The game starts automatically when the page is loaded.
2. The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes on the screen.
3. Click on a letter to make a guess.
4. If the letter is in the word, it replaces the dash(es) in the correct position(s).
5. If the letter is not in the word, a part of the hangman is drawn.
6. The game ends when the word is fully guessed or the hangman is fully drawn.

## Setup and Run Locally
